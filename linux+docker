Using the useradd command:
Open the terminal as root or use sudo before each command.

Type sudo useradd -m -s /bin/bash username (replace "username" with the desired username).
-m creates the user's home directory.
-s /bin/bash sets the default shell to Bash.
Set the password for the new user: sudo passwd username
Enter the new password twice.
